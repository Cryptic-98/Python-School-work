Primitive Data Types - strings, Integers, Floats, Characters, Boolean, Doubles. (describes the simplest data types)
Complex Data Types - Python Data Structures that are used to store and manipulate data.
Examples: Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries.
Note: There are no common arrays in python.
List and Tuples
List - a data structure that is mutable, that is ordered, that is also heterogeneous
- mutable - once a list has been created it can be adjusted meaning you can expand or shrink it by adding or removing items.
- ordered - a list is indexed from zero going up.
- heterogeneous - a list can accommodate different data types. A list can contain integers, strings or floats.
- a list also allows duplicates.
- list uses square brackets
- to add elements to a list we either use append or insert.
- the append method always inserts the new value at the end of the list.
- if you want to insert at a specific index, you have to use the method: insert.
To navigate through the elements of a list, we use loops.
Slicing returns a range of characters or elements from a list
Tuple - a collection of elements that are ordered.
features:
1. NOT mutable - meaning that you cannot change it once it has been created. It cannot be shrunk or expanded.
2. Ordered - meaning that it is indexed (from zero going up)
3. Allows duplicates
Two ways to create a tuple:
1. Using a tuple constructor
2. Using dynamic allocation
