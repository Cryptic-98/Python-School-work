GUI - Graphical User Interface
- tkinter - is a fastest abd easiest way to create GUI application in Python.
steps to create GUI
1. import the tkinter module. tkinter
2. create the main window (container) - the main window serves as the container for all GUI elements.
3. add the widgets (buttons, text fields, radio buttons, etc.) to the main window. You can add any
   number of widgets.
4. apply event triggers to the widgets. You can attach event triggers to the widgets to defines how
   they respond to user interactions.
- events define a state change of an object.

there are two main methods that are used when creating Python application with GUI.
1. Tk() - to create a main window, tkinter offers a method: Tk(screenName, baseName, className).
   to change the name of the window, you can change the class name.
- for GUI to be visible, you need to have the Tk() method, otherwise it will not be visible.
2. mainloop() - used when your application is ready to run. mainloop() is an infinite loop used to
   run the application. waits for an event to occur and process the event as long as the window is not
   closed.
