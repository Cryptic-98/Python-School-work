OOP - Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects.

Object - an instance of a class./ a blueprint to which classes are created.
- an object has an identity (name).
- an object has a stat. For example: for an object such as a rectangle its stat would be its length and
  width.
- an object also has a behaviour.

Classes - a collection of objects, methods, variables or properties.
THEREFORE a class is a data type.
- variables of a class are called member variables.
- functions of a class are called member methods.

The process of destroying objects after they are used is called automatic garbage
