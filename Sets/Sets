Sets operations
- Union of a set - a combination of all elements of different sets.
- Intersection of sets - the common elements among the sets
- Set Difference - for example you have have set A and set B where the difference between the two is the
                   elements that are found in set A but not in set B.
- Symmetric difference - returns the elements that are in either Set A or in Set B but not both.

Sets also use curly brackets ({}).
